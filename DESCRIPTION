Description: Regression methods for estimating the relationship between
    a multivariate exposure and an outcome. The package is oriented toward
    environmental health and environmental epidemiology research but is applicable
    in a variety of settings. The three main areas that are addressed in the the
    package are: 1) exposure to multiple agents; 2) exposure to one or more agents
    over time (e.g. over the course of pregnancy); and 3) confounder adjustment when
