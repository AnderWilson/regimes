## REGression In Multivariate Exposure Settings
[Ander Wilson](http://anderwilson.github.io/)

### Overview

The **regimes** R packages contains regression methods for estimating the relationship between a multivariate exposure and an outcome. The package is oriented toward environmental health and environmental epidemiology research but is applicable in a variety of settings. 


### Installation

The **regimes** package can be installed using **devtools**.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github(repo="AnderWilson/regimes")
library(regimes)
```




- Alternates if you do not have openMP (Mac users) 
```{r install-regimes-2, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("AnderWilson/regimes",
                         ref="noopenmp")
```

- Or install from Mac binary after downloading [`regimes_0.5.13.tgz`](https://github.com/AnderWilson/regimes/blob/gh-pages/regimes_0.5.13.tgz)
```{r install-regimes-3, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("regimes_0.5.13.tgz", 
    repos = NULL, type = .Platform$pkgType)
```
