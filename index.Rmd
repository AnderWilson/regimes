## Regression in Multivariate Exposure Settings

### Overview

The **regimes** R packages contains regression methods for estimating the relationship between a multivariate exposure and an outcome. The package is oriented toward environmental health and environmental epidemiology research but is applicable in a variety of settings. 


### Installation

The **regimes** package can be installed using **devtools**.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github(repo="AnderWilson/regimes")
library(regimes)
```

Note: You may need to install the [**graph**](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/graph.html) and [**Rgraphviz**](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Rgraphviz.html) packages from [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org).
