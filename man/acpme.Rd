\title{Adjustment for confounding in the presence of multivariate exposure}
\usage{
acpme(Z, C, y, int = TRUE, niter, burnin = round(niter/2),
  pen.lambda = NA, pen.type = "eigen")
}
\arguments{
\item{Z}{Matrix of exposures. This should include any interactions of other functions of exposures.}

\item{C}{A n x p matrix of covaraites.}

\item{y}{An n-vector of observed outcomes.}

\item{int}{Logical indicating if an intercept is added to the model. Default is TRUE.}

\item{niter}{Integer number of MCMC iterations to compute including burnin.}

\item{burnin}{Integer number of MCMC iterations to discard as burning.}

\item{pen.lambda}{Non-negative tuning parameter lambda to control the strength of confounder adjustment (strength of prior or size of penalty). A value of NA (defailt) uses BIC to choose the value.}

\item{pen.type}{Choice of penalty. The default is "eigen." Other options are "correlation" and "projection."}
}
\description{
This function simulates the posterier exposure effect using the Bayesian adjustment for confounding in the presence of multivariate exposures (ACPME) meethod.
